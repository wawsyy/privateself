# ABI Files

This directory contains auto-generated contract ABI and address files.

## Files

- `DreamJournalABI.ts` - Contract ABI
- `DreamJournalAddresses.ts` - Deployment addresses by chain

## Generation

These files are automatically generated by running:

```bash
npm run genabi
```

This script reads deployment information from `../deployments/` and generates the TypeScript files.

**Note:** Make sure to deploy the contract first:
```bash
# From pro16 directory
npx hardhat deploy --network localhost  # or sepolia
```

Then run `npm run genabi` from the frontend directory.
